#Misc projects

A collection of projects that probably didn't need their own repo.. mostly for future reference.  


##meetup-api

A project that involved building an 'events' page composed of meetup(community) events and corporate events.  I built a script that pulls in the meetup events using the meetup.com api and the other events through a local json file and then deploys the results via handlebars templates.

##pardot-download-form

Project using a form connecting to pardot to block file downloads prior to filling out the form.  Fun with cookies and forms inside.
